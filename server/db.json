We all know that managing issues and pull requests in our repositories can be challenging.\n\nTo help you optimize your usage of GitHub Projects to plan and track your work from start to finish, I’ll be sharing 10 things you can do with GitHub Projects to make it easier to keep track of your issues and pull requests.\n\n1. Manage your projects with the CLI\nIf you prefer to work from your terminals, we’ve made it more convenient for you to manage and automate your project workflows with the GitHub CLI project command. This essentially allows you to work more collaboratively with your team to keep your projects updated with your existing toolkit.\n\nFor example, if I wanted to add a draft issue to my project “Learning Ruby,” I would do this by first ensuring that I have the CLI installed and I’m authenticated. Once authenticated, I need to find the node id of the project I want to manage with the CLI and the API—you must know the node ID of the project you want to interact with. To find the node ID of the project, I can run the following query:",

      "title": "Lazy Loading In JavaScript",
      "author": "Chisom Kanu",
      "content": "Introduction\nWeb users have high expectations regarding website loading times and performance. Websites that are slow to load can increase bounce rates and dissatisfied users. To address this challenge, developers are constantly seeking different techniques to improve the speed and overall user experience, and one such approach is ”Lazy Loading.” To achieve lazy loading, developers use JavaScript. Using JavaScript, web developers can control when and how specific elements are fetched from the server and rendered on the user’s screen. This article will look into the benefits of lazy loading, ways to implement it, its impacts on web performance, challenges, and best practices.\n\nBenefits of Lazy Loading\nLet’s look at some benefits of using lazy loading. They include:\n\nReduced Bandwith Usage: Loading unnecessary resources can consume substantial bandwidth, affecting users and website owners. Lazy loading can help conserve bandwidth by only loading the needed resources. It becomes beneficial for visitors who may not scroll down to view the entire page, as it can help to prevent them from exceeding their monthly limits.\nIncreased Page Speed Scores and Enhanced SEO Performance: Search engines consider the speed of a page as one of the ranking factors. By improving loading time, lazy loading positively influences page speed scores measured by various tools like Google’s PageSpeed. Higher page speed scores improve SEO and contribute to better retention and conversion rates.\nReduced Server Load: It helps distribute the server load more efficiently by fetching resources on demand. It reduces server stress, allowing it to handle a higher number of user requests.\nImproved Time to Interactivity(TTI): Time to interactivity measures the time it takes for a webpage to become fully interactive, allowing users to interact with buttons, links, and other elements. By prioritizing the loading of important content, lazy loading helps reduce the TTI, providing users with a more enjoyable browsing experience.\nOptimized Mobile Browsing and Improved User Experience: Mobile devices usually have limited processing power and network capabilities. By employing lazy loading, websites adapt to these constraints, delivering a smoother experience and reducing data consumption, making them more mobile-friendly. Users can quickly interact with the visible content without waiting for off-screen resources to load.",

      "title": "Who Is Behind PHP",
      "author": " Huei-Hsin Wang",
      "content": "History Lesson\nBefore discussing the current state, we must consider where PHP comes from. It was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. He created PHP to be able to track visitors to his online resume. He called it Personal Home Page Tools. In 1995, he announced the source code of PHP. Since then, it has been rewritten a few times and got a lot of new features. We can say that PHP has completely changed from what Rasmus built for his needs. Keep this in mind for later in this article.\n\nUsed Terms\nBefore we continue, I’d like to clarify some terms used in this article. There are no “official” terms, so these are the ones that I use:\n\nRFC - Request for Comments. This is a document that describes a new feature for PHP\nPHP Core Maintainers - People who watch and triage the issue tracker and regularly fix issues\nPHP Core Contributors - People who occasionally contribute code and propose ideas to the lang or create RFCs\nPHP Core Voters - People who are allowed to vote on RFCs (includes people from the other two groups)\nPHP Contributors - People who generally contribute to PHP in one way or another. There is a large amount of those behind PHP. The main difference between them and the groups above is that the ones above require specific permissions.\nThe term internals is often wrongly used for the PHP Core Contributors. This is because there is an Internals mailing list, which despite public belief, is free for everyone to join.\n\nAlso, the term core team is not quite adequate because there is no team in the conventional sense behind everything. It’s a collective of supporters.",

      "title": "Tailwind CSS Tips and Tricks Worth Knowing",
      "author": " WRITTEN BY YOAV GANBAR",
      "content": "In this blog post, I’m not going to say why you should use Tailwind. I’ve covered the whole debate enough in a previous post.\n\nThis time I’ll explore some Tailwind tips that can significantly enhance your web development experience. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced Tailwind user, I hope you find something useful.\n\nLet’s go!\n\nDynamic utility classes\nTailwind purges classes that are not being used. This is how it's able to have so many features and still keep our CSS bundle size small. So, if you want to use dynamic class names, you need to have all the class names you want written somewhere in your code. This is in order for Tailwind to be able to statically analyze your code.\n\nFor example something like this won’t work:\n\nconst DoesntWork = () => {\n  const colors = ['red', 'green', 'yellow'];\n  const [color, setColor] = React.useState(colors[0]);\n  const changeColor = () => {\n    setColor('green');\n  };\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className={`w-40 h-40 border bg-${color}-500`}></div>\n      <select\n        value={color}\n        className={`bg-${color}-500`}\n        onChange={(e) => setColor(e.target.value)}\n      >\n        <option value=\"\">choose</option>\n        {colors.map((c) => (\n          <option key={c} value={c}>\n            {c}\n          </option>\n        ))}\n      </select>\n      <button onClick={changeColor}>Change color</button>\n    </>\n  );\n};\nThat is because there is no way for Tailwind to find it’s classes statically. Having bg-${color}-500 needs to be evaluated in runtime. However, if we do use the full class names, the Tailwind compiler can make it work:\n\nconst Works = () => {\n  const colors = ['bg-red-500', 'bg-green-500', 'bg-yellow-500'];\n  const [color, setColor] = React.useState(colors[0]);\n  const changeColor = () => {\n    setColor('bg-green-500');\n  };\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className={`w-40 h-40 border ${color}`}></div>\n      <select\n        value={color}\n        className={`${color}`}\n        onChange={(e) => setColor(e.target.value)}\n      >\n        <option value=\"\">choose</option>\n        {colors.map((c) => (\n          <option key={c} value={c}>\n            {c}\n          </option>\n        ))}\n      </select>\n      <button onClick={changeColor}>Change color</button>\n    </>\n  );\n};\nUsing Tailwind inside CSS\nThere are some times where we are forced to use CSS for our styles; for example, when using a third-party library. We can stick with the Tailwind colors by using the @apply directive or the theme function. Let’s have a look at a code example:",

      "title": "Patterns for Reactivity with Modern Vanilla JavaScript",
      "author": "Marc Grabanski",
      "content": "Reactivity Patterns are Core to Web Development\nWe handle a lot with JavaScript in websites and web apps since the browser is an entirely asynchronous environment. We must respond to user inputs, communicate with servers, log, perform, etc. All these tasks involve updates to the UI, Ajax requests, browser URLs, and navigation changes, making cascading data changes a core aspect of web development.\n\nAs an industry, we associate reactivity with frameworks, but you can learn a lot by implementing reactivity in pure JavaScript. We can mix and match these patterns to wire behavior to data changes.\n\nLearning core patterns with pure JavaScript will lead to less code and better performance in your web apps, no matter what tool or framework you use.\n\nI love learning patterns because they apply to any language and system. Patterns can be combined to solve your app’s exact requirements, often leading to more performant and maintainable code.\n\nHopefully, you’ll learn new patterns to add to your toolbox, no matter what frameworks and libraries you use!",
